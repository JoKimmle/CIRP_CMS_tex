  abstract = {In the field of machining technology the vibration of the system machine, tool and workpiece during processing is the limiting factor of productivity. Therefore the process monitoring of vibration today plays an important role for the real time monitoring of machining processes, as well as for the optimization of simulation models. For monitoring workpiece vibrations, different kinds of strategies are in use. As the piezoelectric acceleration sensors were already field-tested at the department of machining technology (ISF), the use of Contact Emission-Sensors, which are customarily used for stringed instrument tuning, could pose an effective alternative strategy. Proving the possibility of using those sensors, could simplify the future choice of the process monitoring strategy for different machining operations and has cost saving potentials, due to an abbreviated measurement chain. Within this work the workpiece vibration during a 5-axis milling process were detected simultaneously by two monitoring strategies. In these experiments, the detection of vibration by a piezoelectric acceleration sensor was chosen as the reference strategy. The second technique deployed was the measurement of the contact-emission with a common contact microphone. On a milling machine for five-axis simultaneous machining, aluminium shafts were fixed in a three-jaw chuck one-sided and processed with an end mill. The geometry of the milling pockets was varied in the different processing sessions, as well as the feed parameters, in order to obtain both stable and unstable processing. The vibration measurements resulting from the two monitoring strategies were compared in form of time signal and frequency spectrum as well as in the combined form of a 3-dimensional waterfall diagram. Monitoring structure borne noise is an easy, cost-efficient alternative to measures with an acceleration sensor. Delivering reliable results concerning the vibration frequencies, which are multiples of the spindle rotation frequency, this method could be applied for process monitoring. The experiments have shown that the location of the Contact Emission-Sensors has major impact on the quality of results. To implement the Contact Emission-Sensors for this kind of measurements, the sensor must be positioned close to the place of vibration origin taking into account both damping characteristics of all components involved and the way of workpiece clamping.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the reduction of CO2 emissions by moving from fossil to renewable energy sources is on the policy of many governments. At the same time, these governments are forcing the reduction of energy consumption. Since large industries have been in the focus for the last decade, today also small and medium enterprises with production lot size one are increasingly being obliged to reduce their energy requirements in production. Energy-efficient CNC machine tools contribute to this goal. In machining processes, the machining strategy also has a significant influence on energy demand. For manufacturing of lot size one, the prediction of the energy demand of a machining strategy, before a part is manufactured plays a decisive role. In numerous previous studies, analytical models between the energy demand and the machining strategy have been developed. However, their accuracy depends largely on the parameterization of these models by dedicated experiments. In this paper, different machine learning algorithms, especially variations of the decision tree ('DecisionTree', 'RandomForest', boosted 'RandomForest') are investigated for their ability to predict the energy demand of CNC machining operations based on real production data, without the need for dedicated experiments. As shown in this paper, the most accurate energy demand predictions can be achieved with the 'RandomForest' algorithm.},

The automation of data acquisition and labelling allows the generation of a large and varied extrusion 3D printing dataset, containing 1.2 million images from 192 different parts labelled with printing parameters. The thus trained neural network, alongside a control loop, enables real-time detection and rapid correction of diverse errors that is effective across many different 2D and 3D geometries, materials, printers, toolpaths, and even extrusion methods. We additionally create visualisations of the network's predictions to shed light on how it makes decisions.},

Virtual machine tools are useful for simulating machine tools' capabilities in a safe and cost-effective way, but it is challenging to accurately emulate the behavior of the physical tools. When a physical machine tool breaks down or malfunctions, engineers can always go back to check the digital traces of the ``digital-twins'' virtual machine for diagnosis and prognosis. This paper presents an integration of manufacturing data and sensory data into developing ``digital-twins'' virtual machine tools to improve their accountability and capabilities for cyber-physical manufacturing. The sensory data are used to extract the machining characteristics profiles of a digital-twins machine tool, with which the tool can better reflect the actual status of its physical counterpart in its various applications. In this paper, techniques are discussed for deploying sensors to capture machine-specific features, and analytical techniques of data and information fusion are presented for modeling and developing ``digital-twins'' virtual machine tools. Example of developing the digital-twins of a 3-axis vertical milling machine is presented to demonstrate the concept of modeling and building a digital-twins virtual machine tool for cyber-physical manufacturing. The presented technique can be used as a building block for cyber-physic manufacturing development.},

Seven managerial concerns are also discussed as follows: 3D object database management, intellectual property rights of 3D printing, business innovation, ubiquitous manufacturing, lean manufacturing, globalization and deglobalization, and feasibility evaluation and optimization. Then, this study asserts that technical challenges should be addressed to ensure the feasibility of a 3D printing application in a manufacturing context, whereas managerial concerns should be addressed to advance and optimize a 3D printing application.

The proposed intelligent controller uses a multiple-sensor approach for process monitoring. The paper focuses on the module which integrates the sensor-based information in order to provide the controller with the best possible estimates for the tool wear and wear rate. Several approaches are considered for the sensor-integration module. These techniques include a neural network, least-squares regression, and the group method of data handling (GMDH) algorithm. These techniques were determined to be the most promising and feasible approaches for developing this module. Force, temperature and acoustic emission signals recorded during tool wear experiments were used to evaluate the sensor-integration techniques. The results of these tests indicate that the sensor-integration approach proposed in this work will provide more accurate estimates of the tool wear than the single-sensor approach typically used in machining control.},

Some trials to take full advantage of the AE sensor for tool condition monitoring will be conducted relating to the sensor mounting and the signal processing. As a practical solution for the AE sensor mounting, for example, the coolant stream is successfully used as a medium for transmitting the AE wave in the case of milling process monitoring, and for grinding process monitoring, the sensor is mounted in the grinding wheel with other necessary devices so that the AE signal can be transmitted to the outside of the wheel by radio. By applying these methods, it has become possible to take the AE signal from the rotating tools. In terms of AE signal processing for identifying the machining processes, application of the artificial neural network will be introduced.},

  abstract = {Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.},

During the tests surface geometric accuracy assessment was performed and 3D surface roughness parameters were determined. The Sz parameter was selected for the analysis, which was then collated with RMS vibration acceleration and feedrate f. The Sz parameter indirectly provides information on peak to valley height and is characterised by high generalising potential i.e. it is highly correlated to other surface and volume parameters of surface roughness.

Experiments have shown that micromilling of these difficult-to-machine materials is possible despite of their high hardness. Nevertheless, the higher wear of the tools plays a decisive role. When implementing the machining task as five-axis process, it is possible to control the wear distribution by tilting the milling tools. In this paper, a simulation system is presented which determines the loads acting on the cut- ting edge with regard to different criteria, e.g., the machined material or the effective impulse. Based on this knowledge, it is possible to design the milling process to minimize the tool wear and thereby to increase the lifetime of the milling tools. In order to show the applicability of the simulation system, test workpieces were machined and the experimental results are compared to the simulation data.},

In the first part of the paper, the turning experiments have been performed on Nimonic 80A superalloy with coated carbide tools to determine the cutting forces namely main cutting force, feed force and radial force. Three different cutting parameters namely depth of cut, cutting speed and feed rate have been used with three levels. The effect levels of the cutting parameters on cutting forces have been also determined with the analysis of variance (ANOVA) at 95\% confidence level. Secondly, predetermined JC material model parameters have been inputted into the software running by FEM. Thereafter, the turning simulations have been performed by FEM with the same cutting conditions as experimental ones. According to ANOVA results, depth of cut is the most important parameter on Fc and Ff while feed rate is the most important factor on the Fr. Through the closer results (the mean of 6.45\% deviation) of cutting forces between the experiments and simulations, the JC parameters of the material and the boundary conditions of the simulations have been approved with high accuracy.},

On the other hand, sensor fusion is an innovative new technology that makes decisions using multi-sensor information to determine tool status and predict system stability. It is currently not a fully accepted and practiced method. In a nutshell, despite their numerous advantages in terms of efficiency, time saving, and cost, the current situation of sensors used in the industry is not a sufficient level due to the investment cost and its increase with additional signal acquisition hardware and software equipment.

This study reports on experiments of micro-end-milling of the straight groove for AISI 1045 steel. The waveform characteristics of acceleration vibration were revealed, the relationship between acceleration and milling parameters were analyzed and two types of relationship models were developed. The results show that, during micro-end-milling of the straight groove, the components of acceleration vibration from largest to smallest are in turn the transverse acceleration {$\alpha$}Y, the feed acceleration {$\alpha$}X and the axial acceleration {$\alpha$}Z. Compared with feed velocity vf and axial depth of cut ap, the spindle speed n has the highest influence on cutting vibration. The response surface model of acceleration vibration was shown to have a higher prediction accuracy compared to the power function model and is more suitable for the prediction and control of cutting vibration during micro-end-milling.},

Bearing failure is considered to be one of the major causes of breakdown in different rotating machines operating in industry at high and low speeds. Purpose\hspace{0.6em} Vibration in machines is generated due to defective bearings. During use, the condition of the bearings change, hence the vibrations also change and its characteristic basically depends on the cause. Hence, this characteristic feature of the bearing makes it suitable for vibration monitoring and other monitoring techniques. Methods\hspace{0.6em} This article presents the brief review of recent trends in research on bearing defects, sources of vibration and vibration measurement techniques in the time domain, frequency domain and time frequency domain. Results\hspace{0.6em} The study reveals that, the envelope analysis method and time{\textendash}frequency analysis technique are able to detect the bearing fault effectively. The wavelet analysis technique along with artificial neural network and fuzzy logic is also found to be the most effective techniques for fault analysis in rolling element bearing.

However, tool wear is a complex phenomenon occurring in several and different ways in cutting processes, and there is a lack of analytical models that can represent the tool condition. On the other hand, neural networks are considered as a good approach to resolve the absence of an analytical or empirical model. This paper describes a method to characterize the dresser wear condition from acoustic emission (AE) signal. To achieve this, some neural network models are proposed. Initially, a study on the frequency content of the raw AE signal was carried out to determine features that correlate the signal and dresser wear. The features of the signal were obtained from the root mean square and ratio of power statistics at nine frequency bands selected from AE spectra. Combinations of two frequency bands were evaluated as inputs to eight neural networks models, which have been compared with their classification ability. It could be verified that the combination of the frequency bands of 28{\textendash}33 and 42{\textendash}50 kHz best characterized the dresser wear condition. Some of the models produced very good results and can therefore ensure the ground part will be within project specifications.},

  abstract = {Helical milling is an alternative hole-making machining process which presents several advantages when compared to conventional drilling. In the helical milling process, the tool proceeds a helical path while rotates around its own axis. Due to its flexible kinematics, low cutting forces, tool wear, and improved borehole quality may be achieved. This paper presents a review of the helical milling process. As a first paper aiming to describe the current state of the art of helical milling process, the recent works about this process were summarized to point out the future trends in this field. Initially, the advantages of the helical milling were presented with regard to conventional drilling. Subsequently, the kinematics of the process was presented to standardize the nomenclature and to provide knowledge about the movements and parameters of helical milling. It was demonstrated the feed velocity decomposition in frontal and peripheral directions. Undeformed chip and cutting volumes of frontal and peripheral cut were described, and the ratio between the cutting volumes removed by frontal and peripheral cut was demonstrated to be dependent only of the borehole and tool diameters. Cutting forces and temperature studies were also summarized, corroborating that the helical milling is a smooth hole-making process. Afterward, tool life and wear studies in helical milling were summarized, testifying that the tool wear evolution can be monitored in frontal and peripheral cutting edges, with frontal cutting edges, in most cases, defining the tool life. Some statistical and soft computing applications on helical milling were also mentioned. To provide initial guidelines for applying helical milling, a screening of the current literature was performed summarizing equipment and cooling techniques used, and the levels of cutting conditions of helical milling applied for hole-making different materials. The quality of boreholes obtained by helical milling was assessed in terms of dimensional, geometrical, and microgeometrical deviations, besides burr and delamination levels, assuring that it can be obtained finished boreholes with helical milling. In the conclusions, future possibilities on research about helical milling were pointed out. This general review of helical milling may be referenced as a summary of the current results obtained in experimental and theoretical studies and to provide future research needs and opportunities.},

  abstract = {The increasing demand for high-performance components is leading to a greater use of advanced alloys such as DA718, which is, e.g., used in engine parts due to its high-temperature strength. The strict quality requirements pose major challenges for the machining of engine components for aircrafts. Quality deviations along the value chain can lead to high costs due to rework and, in the worst case, rejections in order to prevent material failure within a safety-critical environment. These deviations include, e.g., an increased surface roughness, deviations in the shape tolerances as well as increased internal stresses or surface deformations. Material defects are an additional reason to reject the manufactured components. These are usually inspected only at the end of the value chain and{\textemdash}due to measurement limitations{\textemdash}only if they occur close to the surface of the workpiece. Ultrasonic testing is used in order to detect defects near the surface of the raw part. For the evaluation of the finished part, etching and optical inspection of the surface is used. However, defects inside the components cannot be detected in this way. If material defects are located in areas subjected to intense load changes and high temperatures, the components have to be rejected since engine parts require a high level of fatigue strength. Such rejects constitute a significant economic risk, as a large part of the added value has already been completed and a significant amount of machine time has been invested. Thus, an identification of material defects in an earlier stage of the manufacturing process is required. In this paper, fundamental investigations on machining artificially generated material defects in a micro-milling process and the signal analysis during the pre-turning of turbine disks made of nickel-based materials like DA718 will be presented. Based on force measurements, characteristic signals were identified that could indicate material defects during the turning process.},

It requires responsive and flexible manufacturing operations for producing individualized products in dynamic batch sizes at scale in a cost-effective way. Therefore, manufacturing systems should timely respond to meet changing demands and conditions in the factory, in the supply network, and in customer needs. However, current manufacturing systems fail to adapt to dynamic production environments via changing system configurations and production plans while maintaining stable production performance. Therefore, a manufacturing system is required to be capable of self-optimizing manufacturing operations to achieve flexible, autonomous, and error-tolerant production in the mass personalization context. In this article, we systematically reviewed the literature on Self-Organizing Manufacturing Systems (SOMS) and proposed a complete concept of Self-Organizing Manufacturing Network (SOMN) as the next-generation manufacturing automation technologies for achieving mass personalization. Our review started by tracing the roots, origin, and state-of-the-art research of SOMS and concluded that the existing SOMS work could not achieve the mass personalization goal. As a focus of this review paper, we systematically discussed self-organizing manufacturing's functional requirements to achieve mass personalization and proposed Self-Organizing Manufacturing Network. The concept, functions and essential technological system components (i.e., system modeling and control architecture, peer communications, and adaptive manufacturing control) are discussed by reviewing existing work and highlighting transferrable knowledge from other disciplines.

Data fusion techniques can be employed to combine multiple data sources in order to generate more accurate and reliable information for decision making aimed at achieving the automatic identification of machine, tool, and part failures. This paper focuses on sensorial data quality evaluation using data fusion techniques and machine learning algorithms for intelligent multiple sensor monitoring of manufacturing processes.

With the recent trends of Industry 4.0, it is becoming more common to implement Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to increase the performance of milling processes. As a significant limitation for the efficiency of the machining processes, chatter detection, and avoidance are critical. In this paper, a chatter detection method based on vibration data features for the slot milling process is proposed. This method benefits from a deep learning method, Deep Multi-Layer Perceptron (DMLP). Vibration data was acquired by attaching an accelerometer to the spindle housing during slot milling operations. Fast Fouries Transform (FFT) was applied to time-domain vibratory data. Frequency domain data achieved by FFT was investigated for labeling the occurrence of chatter. These labels were used to train the DMLP algorithm. Time-domain signal features such as root mean square, clearance factor, skewness, crest factor, and shape factor were selected as inputs for the chatter detection algorithm. Finally, validation cuttings were performed for verifying the results of the DMLP algorithm. The results prove that time-domain features can provide enough information about the chatter occurrence in slot milling operations, and the DMLP algorithm proposed in this research can successfully detect the chatter occurrence.},

Measurements of boundary temperatures allowed the determination of the proper magnitude of heat flux applied to the workpiece and the cutting tool. It was found that less than 16\% of the total heat is conducted into the workpiece and that higher feed speeds allowed less heat to conduct into the workpiece. The depth of heat penetration into the workpiece caused the temperature to reach the glass transition temperature of the epoxy only for the slower feed speed. When tested at the same feed per revolution, a PCD 2-flute end mill was the most effective tool in removing the heat from the cutting zone as compared to burr tools.},

  abstract = {The rapidly increasing demand and complexity of manufacturing process potentiates the usage of manufacturing data with the highest priority to achieve precise analyze and control, rather than using simplified physical models and human expertise. In the era of data-driven manufacturing, the explosion of data amount revolutionized how data is collected and analyzed. This paper overviews the advance of technologies developed for in-process manufacturing data collection and analysis. It can be concluded that groundbreaking sensoring technology to facilitate direct measurement is one important leading trend for advanced data collection, due to the complexity and uncertainty during indirect measurement. On the other hand, physical model-based data analysis contains inevitable simplifications and sometimes ill-posed solutions due to the limited capacity of describing complex manufacturing process. Machine learning, especially deep learning approach has great potential for making better decisions to automate the process when fed with abundant data, while trending data-driven manufacturing approaches succeeded by using limited data to achieve similar or even better decisions. And these trends can demonstrated be by analyzing some typical applications of manufacturing process.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on predictive model for Ra and optimization of cutting conditions in high speed hard turning of X40CrMoV5-1 steel by CBN insert. Cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut and coating condition have been considered as cutting parameters. The experiments have been performed in CNC lathe according to Taguchi L32 orthogonal array. The first order mathematical model for the Ra has been developed with multiple regression analysis. Optimization study with analysis of signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios has indicated that feed rate is the negatively most significant factor for Ra under dry cutting conditions. The best surface roughness has been achieved by the lower feed rate and uncoated CBN insert.},
